# AVB prevents modifications like GAPPS or the dualsim patcher from working.
# It detects these "modified" files and prevent them from being loaded.
# Which results in a broken device, after an OTA reactivates AVB.
# AVB is anyway not useful, since we can't relock our device and everybody with direct hardware access can modify it.
# If we set this variable in the customization repo, it won't get used, since it gets already set in the SODP device trees.
